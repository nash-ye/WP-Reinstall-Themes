A simple plugin to allow themes re-installation.

== Description ==

Reinstall Themes is a simple plugin that extends the WordPress built-in package installer. WordPress by default allows themes installation by uploading ZIP archive files. However, the site's admins cannot upgrade any theme using the same standard process. This plugin enables you to do so and saves you valuable time and effort.

WordPress sites' owners or developers used to upload their theme updates using techniques like FTP/SSH/File Managers..etc. This consumes their time and even puts the website at a possible security risk, especially if they forgot the archive files publicly accessible or messed up something else.

Reinstall Theme will fix and remove the common WordPress limitation "destination already exists" and delete the targeted theme directory before installing the newer version. After that WordPress will take place and continue the regular installation or upgrade process.

A common use-case would be when a theme developer wants to upload his theme upgrades easily without the need for advanced deployment tools.
